  <h2>copyrightStart</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec knows to include a copyright year that matches the <a>publishDate</a> in the copyright
    notice. However, for documents developed over a period of several years it is preferable to
    indicate the first year during which the copyright started by setting this option. Note that
    this can always be safely specified since if copyrightStart is the same as the publishDate's
    year it is ignored. <a href='examples/boilerplate.html?copyrightStart=1977'>See an example</a>.
