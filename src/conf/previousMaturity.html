  <h2>previousMaturity</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. When a <a>previousPublishDate</a> is specified, this is
    typically required as well in order to generate the "Previous Version" link since it includes an
    indication of the previous document's maturity level, which cannot be guessed. The values are
    the same as for <a>specStatus</a>. Please note that some values of this option make no sense
    depending on the current document <a>specStatus</a> but that the rules for validating
    consistency are convoluted enough that ReSpec does not try to check them. If you pick the wrong
    value (typically by forgetting to change it), the Link Checker will most likely catch the error
    before publication (the same goes for <a>previousPublishDate</a>).
