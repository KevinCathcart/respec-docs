        <p>
          This chapter lists all the items (JS configuration, elements, attributes, classes) that
          can form the ReSpec language.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>JavaScript Configuration Options</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>extraCSS</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. An array of links to additional style sheets to include. This is one of the
    very few configuration options that is not backwards-compatible with v1 as support for it was
    completely removed (because almost everyone used it wrong, and it was not very useful).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>shortName</h2>
  <p>
    The specification's "short name", which is the name used in W3C URLs such as
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/short-name" (and several other generated URLs).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>specStatus</h2>
  <p>
    The specification's type, which can be a maturity level (e.g. Working Draft) if it is on a
    publication track but can also take other values for other types of documents (e.g. "unofficial"
    for, well, unofficial documents).
  </p>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>base</td>
        <td>
          Just the basic template, not a specification. Use this for public documentation produced by a
          group that has no current clear plan to be officially published.
          <a href='examples/boilerplate.html?specStatus=base'>Example</a>
        </td></tr>
      <tr><td>MO</td>
        <td>
          Member-Only Document. Similar to base, but for documents that need to be clearly flagged as
          being restricted in access to W3C Members. This is rarely, if ever, useful.
          <a href='examples/boilerplate.html?specStatus=MO'>Example</a></td></tr>
      <tr><td>unofficial</td>
        <td>
          An unofficial draft. Use this if you're producing a document outside of W3C but want
          to use styles that match those of W3C specifications, for instance to propose a new document
          while hosting it on your own server. Note that this automatically licences the content under CC-BY v3.0.
          If you want a different copyright, you will need to set the various copyright configuration
          options.

      <tr><td>ED</td>
        <td>
          Editor's Draft. Use this for documents that are maintained in the group's own repository. Requires
          <a>edDraftURI</a> to be specified. This is the default value.

      <tr><td>NOTE</td>
        <td>
          <em>Deprecated</em>. A note. It is unclear to me how this differs from the more specific WG-NOTE and friends.
          Do not use this.

      <tr><td>CG-NOTE</td>
        <td>Co-ordination Group Note. Before Community Groups existed, "CG" was short for "Co-ordination
          Group", but the acronym was highjacked because very few people know what a Co-ordination
          Group does (and many of those who do don't care much for them). The fact that this is
          called "CG-NOTE" is therefore a historical detail, if you are looking for Community Group

          entitled to retain your own copyright instead of transferring it to W3C. Use the copyright
          options for this.

      <tr><td>draft-finding</td>
        <td>
          Draft TAG Finding. If you are one of the Nine and working on a Finding, this is for you.
          Note that for findings, ReSpec currently does not support very robust SotD generation (there don't
          seem to be solid rules for what constitutes a valid Finding SotD) so you'll have to
          specify your own. If there are rules that could be used, please report a bug. ReSpec
          further assumes some conventions for finding URLs that are not consistent throughout all
          of the TAG's repository, specifically that all findings live in
          "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/", that the latest version is at
          "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/shortName", and that the dated versions are at

<section>
  <h2>subtitle</h2>
  <p>
    A simple string that will be used as a subtitle for the specification, right under the title.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>wg</h2>
  <p>
    The full public name of the group, including "Working/Interest/Incubator/etc. Group" as 
    applicable. E.g. "Device APIs Working Group".
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>wgPatentURI</h2>
  <p>
    The URL of the public list of patent disclosures for the group, e.g.
    "http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/43696/status".
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: it is extremely easy to cut and paste this value from somewhere
    else and to fail to notice that you are using the wrong value. Given the legal patent
    implications in pointing to the wrong resource, please triple-check that you are using the link
    relevant to your group. In order to find your group's link, go to <a
    href='http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/'>http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/</a>, locate your
    group, and click on its "(Status)" link.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>wgPublicList</h2>
  <p>
    The short name of the mailing list on which the group conducts its public discussion. E.g.
    "public-device-apis".
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>wgURI</h2>
  <p>
    The URI to the public page of the group. E.g. "http://w3.org/2009/dap/".
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>xgrDocShortName</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. The short name of the group report, e.g. "mbui". Since XGs typically
    produce a single report, it is typical to use the same short name for the report as is used for
    the group, therefore this option defaults to <a>xgrGroupShortName</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>xgrGroupShortName</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. The short name of the group, as included in its URI, e.g. "model-based-ui".
    This is required for XGs.
  </p>
</section>


      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Elements</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>section</h2>
  <p>
    Specification sections are indicated using the <code>section</code> element. They can be
    nested arbitrarily in order to indicate sub-sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first <code>h*</code> child element is taken to be the section's title. You do not need to
    worry about nesting depth: ReSpec will take any element in the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>
    range and renumber it to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It is a common convention
    (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code> for all sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you nest deeper than the <code>h6</code> level, apart from having a hard-to-navigate document
    you will keep getting <code>h6</code> elements.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Special sections</h2>
    <p>
      Some sections with specific IDs have special meanings.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>abstract</dt>
      <dd>
        <em>Required</em>. The specification's abstract, which should contain a paragraph. You shouldn't
        include the "Abstract" title.
      </dd>
      <dt>conformance</dt>
      <dd>
        Specifications often have "Conformance Requirements", which are made of free-form text and
        some boilerplate mentioning RFC 2119. A section with this ID will add the title and the
        boilerplate, while keeping the content you include in it.
      </dd>
      <dt>sotd</dt>
      <dd>
        <em>Required</em>. The "Status of this Document" section. Obviously, you do not need to include the
        endless reams of boilerplate that that section normally contains: that's generated for
        you. However, the PubRules require that part of that boilerplate be "a custom paragraph".
        The content you include in this section is therefore injected as that custom paragraph (you
        can have several, in fact any markup you want is used). Don't spend too much time putting
        together the best of your prose for this, it is almost certain that no one will ever read
        it.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>title</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>title</code> element is left untouched, but its content is used to also set the
    <code>h1</code> title for the specification.
  </p>
</section>


      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>dir</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec defaults the <code>dir</code> attribute on your root element to <code>ltr</code>. If you
    are writing in a language that requires a different directionality, simply set this attribute to
    another value.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>lang</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec defaults the <code>lang</code> attribute on your root element to <code>en</code>. If you
    are writing in another language, simply set this attribute to another value.
  </p>
</section>


      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>remove</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to include content that is used during the generation of the specification but must
    be removed from the output, then add the <code>remove</code> class to it. That is used for
    instance for all the <code>script</code> elements that pull in ReSpec and define its
    configuration.
  </p>
