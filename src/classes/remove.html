  <h2>remove</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to include content that is used during the generation of the specification but must
    be removed from the output, then add the <code>remove</code> class to it. That is used for
    instance for all the <code>script</code> elements that pull in ReSpec and define its
    configuration.
