    If you need to include a one-off reference that isn't in the <a href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>SpecRef database</a>
    or if you need to override an existing reference with specific content, then you can use this
    configuration option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its value is an object that has the reference names as its keys and specific objects describing the
    references as its values. Keys include <code>authors</code> (an array of names), <code>href</code>
    (a link to the reference), <code>title</code> (the reference's name), <code>status</code>
    (its maturity as a standard), and <code>publisher</code> (the organisation publishing it).
    Only <code>title</code> is required.
