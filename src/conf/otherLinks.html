    <h2>otherLinks</h2>
    <p><code>otherLinks</code> gives you the ability to add additional links to the header
        of the document. This is useful if you want to link to other resources, like
        a news feed, a repository, or a relevant website.</p>
    <p>The <code>otherLinks</code> property takes an array that contains a set of objects.
        Each of these objects contains a `<code>key</code>` and a `<code>data</code>`
        property. The <code>`key`</code> is the text that will contain the links to
        the relevant resources. The `<code>data</code>` is another array of objects
        that contain the data describing the resource (with the properties `<code>value</code>`
        which is a string, and `<code>href</code>` which is the URL you want to link
        to).</p>
    <p>The above makes more sense when seen in an example:</p>
    <pre class='example highlight'>
otherLinks: [{
    key: "Version history:",
    data: [{
      value: "Commit History.",
      href: "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/ri-usecases/commits/gh-pages"
 }, {
      value: "Github commits on Twitter.",
      href: "https://twitter.com/respimg_commits"
 }]</pre>
    <p>Becomes:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Version Histroy:</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/ri-usecases/commits/gh-pages">Commit History.</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Github commits on Twitter:</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://twitter.com/respimg_commits">Github commits on Twitter.</a>
        </dd>
    </dl>
