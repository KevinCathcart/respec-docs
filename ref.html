        <p>
          This chapter lists all the items (JS configuration, elements, attributes, classes) that
          can form the ReSpec language.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>JavaScript Configuration Options</h2>
        
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Elements</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>section</h2>
  <p>
    Specification sections are indicated using the <code>section</code> element. They can be
    nested arbitrarily in order to indicate sub-sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first <code>h*</code> child element is taken to be the section's title. You do not need to
    worry about nesting depth: ReSpec will take any element in the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>
    range and renumber it to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It is a common convention
    (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code> for all sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you nest deeper than the <code>h6</code> level, apart from having a hard-to-navigate document
    you will keep getting <code>h6</code> elements.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Special sections</h2>
    <p>
      Some sections with specific IDs have special meanings.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>abstract</dt>
      <dd>
        Required. The specification's abstract, which should contain a paragraph. You shouldn't
        include the "Abstract" title.
      </dd>
      <dt>sotd</dt>
      <dd>
        Required. The "Status of this Document" section. Obviously, you do not need to include the
        endless reams of boilerplate that that section normally contains: that's generated for
        you. However, the PubRules require that part of that boilerplate be "a custom paragraph".
        The content you include in this section is therefore injected as that custom paragraph (you
        can have several, in fact any markup you want is used). Don't spend too much time putting
        together the best of your prose for this, it is almost certain that no one will ever read
        it.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>title</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>title</code> element is left untouched, but its content is used to also set the
    <code>h1</code> title for the specification.
  </p>
</section>


      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>dir</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec defaults the <code>dir</code> attribute on your root element to <code>ltr</code>. If you
    are writing in a language that requires a different directionality, simply set this attribute to
    another value.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>lang</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec defaults the <code>lang</code> attribute on your root element to <code>en</code>. If you
    are writing in another language, simply set this attribute to another value.
  </p>
</section>


      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <section>
  <h2>remove</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to include content that is used during the generation of the specification but must
    be removed from the output, then add the <code>remove</code> class to it. That is used for
    instance for all the <code>script</code> elements that pull in ReSpec and define its
    configuration.
  </p>
