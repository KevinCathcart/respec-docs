          The primary use case for ReSpec is writing W3C specifications and this is what this guide
          covers. It can indeed be used for other document types (this documentation is itself
          written using a different ReSpec profile) but if that is your situation either of two
          cases apply: 1) you're using an existing profile that someone wrote, if so please consult
          the documentation for that profile; or 2) you're developing your own profile in which case
          you will want to read the <a href='dev.html'>Developer's Guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The User's Guide is organised in such a way that a complete newcomer may read it linearly
          and understand everything. That being said, read it in whatever order you think makes most
          sense to you, there are only limited references spanning sections.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Basic Layout</h2>
        <p>
          Here we introduces the basic template that most specifications will want to start from,
          explaining the core principles at play. We also look at basics elements of styling and
          parts that you can't do without.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ReSpec document is essentially a straightforward HTML document that brings in the ReSpec
          script, defines a few configuration variables, and follows a few conventions. The simplest
          way to see it at work is to look at an example — and don't worry if everything isn't
          immediately clear.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" data-include='examples/minimal-w3c.html' data-include-format='text'></pre>
        <p>
          Before anything else, you may wish to see <a href='examples/minimal-w3c.html'>this example
          in action</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is essentially the smallest W3C specification you can write using ReSpec (in
          practice, you could eliminate a few things but then you would have a truly useless
          document). Some of the configuration may seem cryptic, but it is there because all W3C
          documents must have some specific information available — all will be explained soon.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>The Very Basics</h2>
          <p>
            As you can see, the document that is rendered in your browser is quite different from
            the one which is authored here. Yet they are the same document, with a sprinkle of
            ReSpec on top. If you have a tool in your browser such as Firebug, Dragonfly, or other
            such developer tools, you may wish to take a look at the real DOM that is being produced
            and compare it with the source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some basic things can be seen above. First, as you can see from the <code>DOCTYPE</code>
            and the <code>section</code> elements, ReSpec documents are built on HTML5. This does
            not imply that you need to know the ins and outs of HTML5 — just a few simple bits will
            suffice. It also does not imply that the resulting document that you will produce at the
            end will be HTML5. It is the recommended output format, but if you need to you can also
            produce XHTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that the <code>title</code> of the document is reused as the title of the
            specification in the resulting document's <code>h1</code>. It's a small win, but that's
            always something less to repeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>meta</code> element is merely there to indicate the encoding in cases in which
            it may be misunderstood (which are many). It may not always be necessary, but I
            recommend that you leave it there. (You're saving your documents as UTF-8, right? Right?
            Right? Yes, of course you are. Right?)
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Including ReSpec</h2>
          <p>
            You can see that the example above includes a script sourced at 
            <code>http://www.w3.org/Tools/respec/respec-w3c-common</code>. That is the ReSpec 
            profile for W3C specifications. If you look at examples in the wild you may on occasion
            find other links — but use this one. You may also be tempted to save the script to your
            local directory and use it from there. That may on occasion be useful (e.g. if you're on
            a flight and your cache is busted) but I strongly recommend that you link to the 
            canonical URL provided above. The code is regularly updated and this will allow you to
            benefit from bug fixes and enhancements without even having to think about it. To give
            an example: in 2013 the copyright line changed to include Beihang university. Anyone
            using the canonical ReSpec got that upgrade without ever knowing it; while all other
            editors had to make the change manually (typically at publication time, while under
            pressure).
          </p>
          <p>
            You may be wondering what that <code>class='remove'</code> is doing in there. We'll get
            to that later, but be sure to keep it on those <code>script</code> elements.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Specifying Configuration</h2>
          <p>
            In the example you can see a <code>script</code> element defining a
            <code>respecConfig</code> variable. Astute as you are, you've guessed that this is the
            ReSpec configuration. There are many things that can be done there, but we won't get
            into the details right now, but rather explore it piece by piece as needed. No doubt you
            can guess what some of those fields do.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing to remember though is this: that is how configuration is specified in ReSpec.
            Whenever you will see an indication that you can set a configuration option to a given
            value, it will be by modifying this object, simply adding, removing, or changing one of
            its fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also note that this is just a simple JavaScript variable; there is nothing magical about
            the way in which it is declared (it just needs to be fully defined when the load event
            triggers). If for instance you are working on a family of specifications that share
            some information (e.g. working group, editors) you can specify those in a common file
            which you load, and then add the document-specific fields.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Sections</h2>
          <p>
            Sections in ReSpec specifications are specified using — shock! — the
            <code>section</code> element. These can be nested, and the first <code>h*</code>
            child element is taken to be the section's title. You do not need to worry about nesting
            depth: ReSpec will take any element in the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> range and
            renumber it to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It is a common convention
            (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code> for all sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two first sections in this example specification are special (and required). We will
            get to those in the next chapter. For the time being, just accept them as part of the 
            basic specification template.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last section in the specification is a regular section — it is simply there in order
            for there to be a little bit of content. There is no requirement to start a document
            with an introduction, though of course that's not necessarily a bad idea.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Language</h2>
          <p>
            W3C specifications are assumed to be in English. As a result, if you don't specify a
            <code>lang</code> attribute on your root element, ReSpec will add <code>lang='en'</code>
            as well as <code>dir='ltr'</code>. This does not prevent you from using other languages
            though: simply specify your own <code>lang</code> (in which case you may wish to also
            specify your own <code>dir</code> for good measure).
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Essential W3C Boilerplate</h2>
        <p>
          W3C boilerplate is extremely repetitive, but beneath the tedium is a wealth of options and
          subtle variations that are precisely what makes crafting the boilerplate by hand so hard
          to get right. This covers options for specification maturity, publication dates,
          alternatives (editor's drafts, other versions, other formats...), legalese variants, the
          various W3C specification URLs, the people writing it, information about the working
          group, and core sections such as Abstract, Status of this Document, and Conformance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will start by using an example of a basic specification very similar to the one used in
          the previous section.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight" data-include='examples/boilerplate.html' data-include-format='text'></pre>
        <p>
          You can <a href='examples/boilerplate.html'>see the result in action</a>.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          There's a nifty trick that you will likely want to keep in your toolbox: many of ReSpec's
          configuration options can be specified in the query string (separated by semicolons) and
          they override the options specified in the source. We will use it a lot in this
          documentation so as to avoid having to generate examples for each small change that is
          possible (there are quite a few). So if I want to test the <a>subtitle</a> option without
          generating a copy of the same example with just that option changed, instead of accessing 
          <code>examples/boilerplate.html</code> I can simply go to
          <code>examples/boilerplate.html?subtitle=This%20is%20a%20subtitle</code>.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Title, Subtitle, Short Name</h2>
          <p>
            As noted in the previous chapter, the <code>title</code> of the document is reused as
            the title of the specification in the resulting document's <code>h1</code>. That way,
            they are always in sync and you need not worry about specifying it twice. Including a
            title is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Optionally, you can also specify a subtitle. The <a>subtitle</a> configuration option
            takes a simple string that will be used as a subtitle for the specification, right under
            the title. You can <a
            href='examples/boilerplate.html?subtitle=Breaking%20the%20web%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom'>look
            at an example</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifications typically require having a "short name", which is the name used (amongst
            other places) in the canonical "http://w3.org/TR/short-name/" URLs. This is specified
            using the <a>shortName</a> option, as seen in the example above.
            <a href='examples/boilerplate.html?shortName=something-else'>Look at an example</a>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Working Group Information</h2>
          <p>
            Most (but not all) W3C documents are produced by groups of some sort: Working Groups
            (WG), Interest Groups (IG), Incubator Groups (XG, now defunct), Coordination Groups, the
            TAG, and Community or Business Groups (CG, BG). For simplicity, we will be referring to
            all of the above as "Working Groups", since one should not be required to understand the
            many subtleties of the W3C Process in order to write a good specification. Configuration
            options that are prefixed with <code>wg</code> work equally well for all group types.
          </p>
          <p>
            When these groups release a document, they must include some information that is
            relevant and specific to them — all of this information is required. Documents produced
            in other situations (e.g. Submissions, unofficial drafts, etc.) don't require these
            options.
          </p>
          <div data-include='src/conf/wg.html'></div>
          <div data-include='src/conf/wgURI.html'></div>
          <div data-include='src/conf/wgPublicList.html'></div>
          <div data-include='src/conf/wgPatentURI.html'></div>
          <p>
            The result of changing these configuration options can be seen in the "Status of this
            Document" section. Here is <a
            href='examples/boilerplate.html?wg=Supercool%20Incubator%20Group;wgURI=http://berjon.com/;wgPublicList=public-supercool-xg;wgPatentURI=http://berjon.com/'>an
            example with different values</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incubator Groups require some additional information in addition to the above, but since
            this group type no longer exists they are deprecated:
            <a href='ref.html#xgrGroupShortName'>xgrGroupShortName</a>,
            <a href='ref.html#xgrDocShortName'>xgrDocShortName</a>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Specification Status</h2>
          <p>
            At any given time a specification must be in a given status. The <dfn class='config'>specStatus</dfn> option
            indicates which status that is. Typically, a status has implications in terms of what other options may be
            required. For instance, a document that is intended to become a Recommendation eventually and that is not the
            First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of that specification will require <a>previousPublishDate</a> and
            <a>previousMaturity</a> to be specified. The following table lists the values currently understood. Each of
            them has an example link demonstrating what it produces.

                  be used, please report a bug. ReSpec further assumes some conventions for finding URIs that are not
                  consistent throughout all of the TAG's repository, specifically that all findings live in 
                  "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/", that the latest version is at "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/shortName",

          <h2>Extra Styling</h2>
          <p>
            You can easily see that the resulting documents contain a lot of styling that does not appear in the
            source. That is because ReSpec loads both the W3C stylesheet that corresponds to the type of document
            that you are editing, as well as a its own CSS that work with its specific features.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does not prevent you from adding your own style on top if you so desire. You can include style
            directly in the source document using the usual HTML methods, but this is no recommended since in some
            cases they may clash with publication rules that require the W3C style to be the last to be included
            (ReSpec will try to enforce this however). Furthermore, people usually find it convenient to point to
            external stylesheets rather than inline them in the document, but when making an official publication
            it cannot depend on an external resource. In order to address this, it is recommended that in order to
            add style you use the <dfn class='config'>extraCSS</dfn> option. It takes an array of URIs to external
            stylesheets, will include them in the correct positions, and will inline them for you.

          <h2>Dates</h2>
          <p>
            The process of publishing specifications typically involves releasing multiple versions in a row that
            have specific dates (so that people can see the evolution, and also for IP reasons). Additionally,
            some specification statuses involve delimited review periods. These are all specified using date-related
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format used for all dates is <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>publishDate</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The publication date of the present document. For documents that are in flux, such as Editor's Drafts
              or unofficial documents, this is best left unspecified as ReSpec will use the document's last modification
              date (as provided by the browser) in order to set this. For documents intended for official publication,
              this is normally required.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>previousPublishDate</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              When there is a previous release of a given specification, this is used to generate the "Previous Version"
              link. It is required for Recommendation Track documents.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>previousMaturity</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              When a <a>previousPublishDate</a> is specified, this is typically required as well in order to generate the 
              "Previous Version" link since it includes an indication of the previous document's maturity level, which
              cannot be guessed. The values are the same as for <a>specStatus</a>. Please note that some values of
              this option make no sense depending on the current document <a>specStatus</a> but that the rules for 
              validating consistency are convoluted enough that ReSpec does not try to check them. If you pick the wrong
              value (typically by forgetting to change it), the Link Checker will most likely catch the error before
              publication (the same goes for <a>previousPublishDate</a>).
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>lcEnd</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              Documents that are in Last Call (<a>specStatus</a> is "LC") are required to indicate an end date for the review
              period. Use this to provide it.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>crEnd</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              Documents that are in Candidate Recommendation (<a>specStatus</a> is "CR") are required to indicate a date 
              before which the group guarantees that it will not move to the next step on the track (PR or REC) so that
              implementers know how long they have. Use this to provide that date.

          <h2>Editors &amp; Authors</h2>
          <p>
            Every specification must have some <dfn class='config'>editors</dfn> (at least one) and may have some 
            <dfn class='config'>authors</dfn>. Both of these options take arrays of simple objects that have the following
            fields:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>name</dt>
            <dd>
              The name of the person. This field is required (and the only required one).
            </dd>
            <dt>url</dt>
            <dd>
              The URL for the person, can be used to point to the person's personal site.
            </dd>
            <dt>company</dt>
            <dd>
              The company for which the person is working.
            </dd>
            <dt>companyURL</dt>
            <dd>
              The URL for the above company.
            </dd>
            <dt>mailto</dt>
            <dd>
              An email with which to contact the person.
            </dd>
            <dt>note</dt>
            <dd>
              Additional information on the person, often used to indicate a former employer (if the person
              switched companies during edition) or to clarify that an editor is no longer active even if her
              name is still attached to the document out of respect for her past contributions.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            Editors are the people in charge of the document. Authors are people who produced substantial contributions,
            but did not manage the document per se. Most of the time authors are not specified, but that practice
            varies between groups (it is more common in XGs for instance). Here is an example of specifying two
            editors and one author (with the surrounding document clipped for readability):
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            var respecConfig = {
                // ...
                editors: [
                      {   name:       "Robin Berjon",

                          company:    "Robineko",

                      },
                      {   name:       "Billie Berthezène-Berjon",
                          company:    "Catwoman"

                          company:    "Aristocracy",
                          note:       "until &lt;time>1852-11-27&lt;/time>"

        <section>
          <h2>Special Sections</h2>
          <p>
            There are three "special" <code>section</code> elements in the example, with IDs <code>abstract</code>,
            <code>sotd</code>, and <code>conformance</code>; the first two are required for W3C documents, the third
            one is recommended for normative documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>abstract</code> section is simply the specification's abstract, the very first item of content
            right at the beginning. You can include anything from a simple paragraph to a more detailed overview of
            the topics involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>sotd</code> section is there because the W3C publication rules require there to be a non-boilerplate,
            human-customised paragraph as part of the "Status of this Document" section. By all accounts that's a bug in the
            publication rules, but until such a time as we get them fixed this will be required. Don't waste too much time
            saying anything useful there, the only people who will read it are those who check to see that there is indeed
            a non-boilerplate paragraph there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>conformance</code> section is useful to have in normative documents. As you can see, in the source
            there is only a paragraph and no title, yet in the resulting document there are three paragraphs (the first two
            have been added automatically) and a title. The added paragraphs are essentially boilerplate but are useful
            in clarifying the normative status of specific sections and listing the RFC 2119 keywords that are normally
            used for testable assertions in the specification. The part that you write is dedicated to providing more
            information about how conformance works for your given specification, it is often used to define product
            conformance classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If testable assertions and conformance classes sound like gibberish to you, it is highly recommended that you
            read <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/test-methodology/'>http://www.w3.org/TR/test-methodology/</a>. In fact,
            even if you understand what those are but haven't read this document, go read it.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Editor's Drafts</h2>
          <p>
            Most groups maintain some form of version control system which is exposed over the web so that people
            can keep track of what edits are being made to a specification in between official releases. It is
            often useful to point to such documents, including from released specifications, so that people wishing
            to report issues can make sure that they aren't already fixed, and in general get the very latest version.
            Two options control this.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>edDraftURI</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              The URI of the Editor's Draft, used in the header. This is required for <a>specStatus</a> = "ED". Any
              good old URI will do the trick.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>prevED</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              Sometimes it happens that a document is moved in the version control system, passed from one group
              to another, or split into several smaller documents. In such cases since the version control information 
              is harder to find, this option can be used to point to a previous Editor's Draft. Rarely used.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Recommendation Track</h2>
          <p>
            If you are working on a new version of an existing Recommendation, then it is required that your document
            point to that previous version. This is done using the <dfn class='config'>prevRecShortname</dfn> and
            <dfn class='config'>prevRecURI</dfn> options, which respectively provide the <a>shortName</a> for the
            existing Recommendation (e.g. "SVG", as opposed to "SVG2") and its URI. You can 
            <a href='eg/boilerplate.html?prevRecShortname=dahuts-v0;prevRecURI=http://w3.org/TR/dahuts-v0/'>look at an example</a>.
            If <a>prevRecURI</a> is not specified but <a>prevRecShortname</a> is, the latter will be used to generate
            the former by prefixing "http://www.w3.org/TR/" to it. Note however that while in the overwhelming majority
            of cases this works, it is not recommended to use this approach since if the Recommendation is later Rescinded,
            the link will be stale. Instead, use the dated link to the Recommendation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What follows in this section is a corner case which you most likely don't need to worry about unless you
            are Thomas Roessler. Given that you're still reading, you must be Thomas (hi!). Thomas, you already know how this
            works, so you don't need to read any further either.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process for the publication of Notes is not entirely clearly cut. When producing multiple drafts of a
            Note in succession, some groups will simply publish them all as Notes one after the other, probably indicating
            in the abstract or SotD if they intend to work further on this document or if it is final. Since Notes are
            not normative and entail no IP concerns, they don't need an elaborate process and this is considered the sane
            option. If that's what you're doing, then you won't need this.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other groups however it is preferred to use a publication process for Notes that is closer to that which
            is used for Recommendation Track documents, typically: FPWD -> WD (<var>n</var> times) -> LC -> Note. Given that
            any group may decide at any time to release a Rec-Track document as a Note instead (often because it has
            been abandoned) this is Process-kosher but it is nevertheless somewhat weird since it uses specification statuses
            that have IP implications in a situation in which there are none. Confused? That's okay. If you ever find yourself
            in such a situation, simply set <dfn class='config'>noRecTrack</dfn> to <code>true</code>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Related Documents</h2>
          <p>
            A specification does not always travel alone. In some cases, there can be an accompanying 
            <dfn class='config'>errata</dfn> document, which you can specify by providing its URI 
            (<a href='eg/boilerplate.html?specStatus=REC;errata=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/erratum'>example</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, some groups occasionally find it desirable to produce alternative formats in which people
            may read the specification. For instance, to access it on an ebook reader you may produce an ePub
            alternative, or if your specification is intended to be read by printing devices you might use PDF.
            The <dfn class='config'>alternateFormats</dfn> option is set to an array of objects, each of which has
            two required fields: <code>uri</code>, for the link to the alternate document, and <code>label</code>,
            for a human readable string that matches it.

          <h2>Copyrights</h2>
          <p>
            By default, W3C specifications all get the regular W3C copyright notice and document licence, except
            for unofficial documents which are under CC. In some cases however, that is not appropriate, and can
            be controlled with the following options.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>additionalCopyrightHolders</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              For regular documents, this is used to specify that additional parties hold a copyright jointly with
              W3C on this document. This is typically used when publishing documents that were developed in
              cooperation with other friendly SDOs such as the IETF or OASIS. The option is simply some text giving
              the addition copyright holders. For unofficial documents, this string is used to replace the default
              CC licence. <a href='eg/boilerplate.html?additionalCopyrightHolders=Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force'>Example
              for regular documents</a> and <a href='eg/boilerplate.html?additionalCopyrightHolders=Copyright%20©%201977%20Robin%20Berjon;specStatus=unofficial'>example
              for unofficial documents</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn class='config'>copyrightStart</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              ReSpec knows to include a copyright year that matches the <a>publishDate</a> in the copyright notice.
              However, for documents developed over a period of several years it is preferable to indicate the
              first year during which the copyright started by setting this option. Note that this can always be
              safely specified since if copyrightStart is the same as the publishDate's year it is ignored.
              <a href='eg/boilerplate.html?copyrightStart=1977'>See an example</a>.

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Several tools that help you maintain a sane structure are described here, notably how to
          use <code>section</code> and <code>h*</code> elements, automatic table of contents,
          numbering, section links, handling of figures, examples, code highlighting, as well as

        <h2>Common Inline Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Many repetitive tasks happen at the level of inline text, and ReSpec helps with those as
          well. This chapter covers references, along with the <a
          href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>Specifiction database</a>, the handling of
          abbreviations and acronyms, automatic RFC 2119 keyword detection, <code>dfn</code>
          definitions, and easier in-document linking.

        <h2>Creating a Static Snapshot</h2>
        <p>
          Once your specification is ready to be published on the W3C website, you will need to
          create a static snapshot. This chapter covers this process, what happens, the various
          formats, RDFa support, diffs, and what to do with the result once you have it.

        <h2>WebIDL Support</h2>
        <p>
          This chapter is about WebIDL, the schema language for APIs. ReSpec has extensive WebIDL
          support, but naturally if you're not writing an API specification then you can definitely
          save yourself the trouble and skip this section.
