        <p>
          The primary use case for ReSpec is writing W3C specifications and this is what this guide
          covers. It can indeed be used for other document types (this documentation is itself
          written using a different ReSpec profile) but if that is your situation either of two
          cases apply: 1) you're using an existing profile that someone wrote, if so please consult
          the documentation for that profile; or 2) you're developing your own profile in which case
          you will want to read the <a href='dev.html'>Developer's Guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The User's Guide is organised in such a way that a complete newcomer may read it linearly
          and understand everything. That being said, read it in whatever order you think makes most
          sense to you, there are only limited references spanning sections.

        <h2>Basic Layout</h2>
        <p>
          Here we introduces the basic template that most specifications will want to start from,
          explaining the core principles at play. We also look at basics elements of styling and
          parts that you can't do without.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Essential W3C Boilerplate</h2>
        <p>
          W3C boilerplate is extremely repetitive, but beneath the tedium is a wealth of options and
          subtle variations that are precisely what makes crafting the boilerplate by hand so hard
          to get right. This covers options for specification maturity, publication dates,
          alternatives (editor's drafts, other versions, other formats...), legalese variants, the
          various W3C specification URLs, the people writing it, information about the working
          group, and core sections such as Abstract, Status of this Document, and Conformance.

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Several tools that help you maintain a sane structure are described here, notably how to
          use <code>section</code> and <code>h*</code> elements, automatic table of contents,
          numbering, section links, handling of figures, examples, code highlighting, as well as
          inclusions and transformations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Common Inline Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Many repetitive tasks happen at the level of inline text, and ReSpec helps with those as
          well. This chapter covers references, along with the <a
          href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>Specifiction database</a>, the handling of
          abbreviations and acronyms, automatic RFC 2119 keyword detection, <code>dfn</code>
          definitions, and easier in-document linking.

      <section>
        <h2>Creating a Static Snapshot</h2>
        <p>
          Once your specification is ready to be published on the W3C website, you will need to
          create a static snapshot. This chapter covers this process, what happens, the various
          formats, RDFa support, diffs, and what to do with the result once you have it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>WebIDL Support</h2>
        <p>
          This chapter is about WebIDL, the schema language for APIs. ReSpec has extensive WebIDL
          support, but naturally if you're not writing an API specification then you can definitely
          save yourself the trouble and skip this section.
