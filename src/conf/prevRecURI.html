  <h2>prevRecURI</h2>
  <p>
    If you are working on a new version of an existing Recommendation, use this to indicate what
    its URL was.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a <a>prevRecURI</a> is not specified but <a>prevRecShortname</a> is, the latter will be used
    to generate the former by prefixing "http://www.w3.org/TR/" to it. Note however that while in
    the overwhelming majority of cases this works, it is not recommended to use this approach since
    if the Recommendation is later Rescinded, the link will be stale. Instead, use the dated link to
    the Recommendation.
