  <h2>data-transform</h2>
  <p>
    This is a list of white space separated JavaScript function names that will be called in turn
    in order to transform the content inside the given element. The functions need to be globally
    available.

    Each function gets called with the ReSpec <code>utils</code> object and a string of the content
    to transform. If applied on an element that is also using <code><a>data-include</a></code>, a
    third parameter giving the URL of the loaded content is provided.
