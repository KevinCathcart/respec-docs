  <h2>data-include</h2>
  <p>
    A URL pointing to a resource, relative to the including document. The content will get included
    as a child of the element on which the inclusion is performed (unless
    <code><a>data-include-replace</a></code> is used, in which case it replaces the element),
    replacing its existing content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The include filter runs recursively so that included content that contains
    <code><a>data-include</a></code> attributes will work (just be sure not to build a circular loop
    in there, ReSpec won't detect it if only because it doesn't mind if you're shooting yourself in
    the foot).
  </p>
  <p>
    By default the inclusion is asynchronous, which means that the included content may or may not
    be further processed by ReSpec after it gets added to the DOM (the result won't be deterministic
    and so is only useful if the content is <em>not</em> meant to be further processed). If you wish
    to ensure that ReSpec processing is applied to the content, use
    <code><a>data-include-sync</a></code>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the processing pipeline, inclusion happens right after everything to do with the document's
    headers, style, and transformations have happened, which means that all the processing to do
    with structure, inlines, WebIDL, and everything else is applied to the included content as if it
    had always been part of the source.
