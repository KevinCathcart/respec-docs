  <h2>data-include-sync</h2>
  <p>
    Inclusion is normally asynchronous, which means that the content may or may not get further
    processed by ReSpec depending on the point at which it gets inserted (which isn't 
    deterministic). If you need to ensure that content gets injected before the rest of the
    pipeline runs, set this to any truthy value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be warned that there is a steep performance penalty in doing so, since all ReSpec processing
    will effectively pause until the content has been fully fetched and inserted.
