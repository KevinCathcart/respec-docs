  <h2>data-include-format</h2>
  <p>
    Data is normally included as HTML (injected into the DOM as such) but there are time when you
    want to include content as text. If so, set this attribute to <code>text</code>. That is the
    only supported value (you can also use <code>html</code>, but that's the default behaviour).
