  <h2>xgrDocShortName</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. The short name of the group report, e.g. "mbui". Since XGs typically
    produce a single report, it is typical to use the same short name for the report as is used for
    the group, therefore this option defaults to <a>xgrGroupShortName</a>.
