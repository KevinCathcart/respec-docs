    For regular documents, this is used to specify that additional parties hold a copyright jointly
    with W3C on this document. This is typically used when publishing documents that were developed
    in cooperation with other friendly SDOs such as the IETF. The option is simply some text giving
    the addition copyright holders. For unofficial documents, this string is used to replace the
