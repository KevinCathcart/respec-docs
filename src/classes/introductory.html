  <h2>introductory</h2>
  <p>
    When set on a section indicates that it is meant as introductory material that need not be
    linked to from the table of contents. The abstract, SotD, and ToC sections automatically fall
    into this category (but you need not worry about flagging them as such).

    If you <em>do</em> wish all the introductory sections to be present in the ToC, see
    <a>tocIntroductory</a>.
