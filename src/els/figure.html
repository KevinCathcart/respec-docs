    Specification figures are indicated using the <code>figure</code> element, with a nested
    <code>figcaption</code>. They can occur anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Table of Figures is generated and inserted in the document if you include an element with
    ID <code>tof</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Figures can be automatically linked to using a link pointing to their ID with no content
    (e.g. <code>&lt;a href='#foo-figures'>&lt;/a></code>).
