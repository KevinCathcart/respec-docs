      <p>
        ReSpec v3 is composed of many small and (mostly) simple plugins that perform one task
        (sometimes two) and do that well. You can think of it as a set of small Unix command-line
        utilities through which content is piped (except that in some cases they can operate
        asynchronously). Removing or adding plugins is trivial, and defining new ones is very
        simple. The only difficulty is that there are quite a few files and that you need to know
        where to look for what. This guide will explain the basic layout and architecture,
        introduce you to writing plugins, and tell you how to create your own ReSpec profile so as
        to be able to edit your own document types.

      <h2>Project Basics</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter covers how to get the code, where bugs and discussion take place, how to run
        a development version of the code, what its layout is, pointers for the various
        dependencies, the testing system, how the profile is compiled (only needed for releases),
        and what the general architecture of ReSpec is.

      <h2>Anatomy of a Plugin</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter we look at how a plugin is structured and how it ticks, how to handle its
        dependencies including to non-Javascript resources, how context and continuations work
        (including for asynchronous processing), what is available from the <code>utils</code>
        plugin, and some general information about how the templating language is used.

      <h2>Defining Your Own Profile</h2>
      <p>
        Creating your own profile is trivial: it can often consist of a very simple Javascript
        file, a little bit of CSS, and perhaps a straightforward HTML template. This chapter
        covers all of this, plus important information about plugin ordering and how to build and
        release your profile.
