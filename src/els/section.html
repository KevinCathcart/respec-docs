<section>
  <h2>section</h2>
  <p>
    Specification sections are indicated using the <code>section</code> element. They can be
    nested arbitrarily in order to indicate sub-sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first <code>h*</code> child element is taken to be the section's title. You do not need to
    worry about nesting depth: ReSpec will take any element in the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>
    range and renumber it to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It is a common convention
    (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code> for all sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you nest deeper than the <code>h6</code> level, apart from having a hard-to-navigate document
    you will keep getting <code>h6</code> elements.

  <section>
    <h2>Special sections</h2>
    <p>
      Some sections with specific IDs have special meanings.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>abstract</dt>
      <dd>
        Required. The specification's abstract, which should contain a paragraph. You shouldn't
        include the "Abstract" title.
      </dd>
      <dt>sotd</dt>
      <dd>
        Required. The "Status of this Document" section. Obviously, you do not need to include the
        endless reams of boilerplate that that section normally contains: that's generated for
        you. However, the PubRules require that part of that boilerplate be "a custom paragraph".
        The content you include in this section is therefore injected as that custom paragraph (you
        can have several, in fact any markup you want is used). Don't spend too much time putting
        together the best of your prose for this, it is almost certain that no one will ever read
        it.
